# Atopos Transparency Report

## Purpose
This report describes what Atopos measures and publishes to support independent review, and what is not claimed.

## Validation approach (high level)
Atopos periodically performs validation runs that check for:
- absence of secret material being accepted via server routes,
- absence of secret-bearing database fields (schema-level),
- absence of sensitive leakage in application log outputs (bounded scan),
- enforcement of envelope size invariants in privacy modes,
- routing mode behaviour matching configuration expectations.

Validation results are published in a *publish-safe* format under:
- [`evidence/latest/`](./evidence/latest/)

## Latest published evidence
See:
- [Evidence summary](./evidence/latest/EVIDENCE_SUMMARY.md)

## What we measure
- Application-level behaviours that indicate keys/secrets are not being transmitted or stored.
- Database schema indicators for secret-bearing field names (schema-only checks).
- Log outputs generated by the application (bounded scan).
- Fixed-size envelope invariants for padded modes.
- Routing mode configuration behaviour at runtime.

## What we do not measure
- External infrastructure logs outside the application’s control (e.g., some reverse-proxy layers).
- Compromise of client devices.
- Actions by malicious room participants.
- Global passive adversary correlation beyond the chosen routing mode.

## Conservative claims
Atopos aims to publish conservative, reviewable claims and to avoid marketing language.
